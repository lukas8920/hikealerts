# Microsoft Fabric and AI Hackathon: Hiking Alerts

## Use Case Description
When viewing and planning tracks, popular hiking apps do not display current information by official institutions for hiking tracks in a standard format (dangers, weather impacts, closures etc.). Instead, those apps heavily rely on their individual communities updating the information manually.

Empowered by Microsoft's AI and Fabric services, we are able to standardize the information provided by different institutions in a global context. The purpose of the UI and the API is to provide transparency on the accessibility of certain hiking tracks, making hiking safe and a more enjoyable experience.
