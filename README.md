# Microsoft Fabric and AI Hackathon: Hiking Alerts

## Use Case Description
When viewing and planning tracks, popular hiking apps do not display current information by official institutions for hiking tracks in a standard and holistic format. Instead, those apps heavily rely on their respective communities updating the information manually.

This relevant information for hikers might include dangers, weather impacts, closures etc (in the following called events).

Empowered by Microsoft's AI and Fabric services, we are able to standardize the events issued by different institutions in a global context. The purpose of our website and the API is to provide transparency on the accessibility of hiking tracks, making hiking safer and a more enjoyable experience!
